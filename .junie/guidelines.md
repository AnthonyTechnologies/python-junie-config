## Python Development

`docs/python-styleguide` describes in detail the guidelines of how you should write python code for this project.  

Remember the key general guidelines in the style guide that must be followed at all times:
- **project_structure.md**: How the project is structured
- **syntax.md**: The details on how the Python code should be written
- **semantics.md**: The details on how to use certain aspects of Python
- **code_file_layout.md**: Outlines how python code files should be structured

For certain files or aspects of the project, there are additional, specific guidelines that must be followed. These are
described in the style guide in their respective files. If their guidelines conflict with general guidelines, then the
guidelines in the specific file take precedence.
- **unit_tests.md**: How tests should be created and used
- **performance_tests.md**: How performance tests should be created and used
- **examples.md**: How examples should be created
- **module_tutorials.md**: How module tutorials should be created
- **package_tutorials.md**: How package tutorials should be created
